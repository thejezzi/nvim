# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim - thejezzi

This was the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
and is the config I use for everyday work. God bless the people that maintain
and work on neovim and all those plugins!

## Prerequisites

Neovim 0.10.0 or higher is required as some plugins require it e.g nvim-snippets.
